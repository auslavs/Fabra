# Fabra
An F# DSL for the Zebra Print Langauge (ZPL)

## Introduction

Fabra is an experimental project to provide a more straightforward method for creating ZPL labels for F# developers.
The hope is that it will make it easier to create labels and provide a more expressive way to create dynamic content.
For example, ZPL doesn't provide you with the option to display or hide content based on conditional logic.
With the help of F#'s concise syntax, we can programmatically change the content in a way that is clear to the developer. 

Work on Fabra has just started, so it only includes the parts required for basic labels.
There is no goal to include X amount of ZPL coverage by a specific date.
This is a personal project, the plan is to expand on the work as my needs require.
I hope that by sharing this, someone else will benifit as well.
